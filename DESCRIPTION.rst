HTTPie (pronounced *aitch-tee-tee-pie*) is a command line HTTP client.
Its goal is to make CLI interaction with web services as human-friendly
as possible. It provides a simple ``http`` command that allows for sending
arbitrary HTTP requests using a simple and natural syntax, and displays
colorized output. HTTPie can be used for testing, debugging, and
generally interacting with HTTP servers.
